  "abstract": "Designing chemicals and materials is a winner-takes-all game in a chemical space. Out of a nearly endless list of candidate chemicals, the best option can practically be made of a small fraction. Of those, a mere handful may actually be viable in the market because of regulatory restrictions, manufacturability, and economic viability or Capital Expenditure for manufacturing. This attrition is so expensive, especially for new startups, that investment firms often shy away from chemical discovery. Generative AI has ushered in significant improvements in the optimization of chemical design and discovery. In this paper, we analyze the potential of Generative AI for chemicals and materials using recent trends and models developed in the field of Artificial Intelligence. We examine how generative design can be leveraged to create synthetic pathways for molecules, optimize for properties, and enhance the understanding of chemical design for drug discovery."

  "abstract": "Designing chemicals and materials is a winner-takes-all game in a chemical space. Out of a nearly endless list of candidate chemicals, only a single best can practically be made at the required scale first. Of those, a mere handful will be submitted to the clinic or the market because of regulatory requirements or business needs, such as Internal Business Approval or Capital Expenditure for manufacturing. This attrition is also expensive, derailing the sustainability equation. Navigating the chemical labyrinth by faster exploration is a clear advantage. Generative AI has unlocked unprecedented chemical combinations with enhanced capabilities. Generative models are trained with sufficient data to produce new molecules or materials. However, while generative models are key, the real crown jewel lies in autonomous validation and optimization protocols from digital twins to self-driving labs. Digital and robotic twins replicate expensive and regulated processes through complex simulations and automation efforts combined with physical testing. The intersection of materials and chemicals is ideal for generative design and the magic happens in the automation and robotics for validation and testing. These generative-AI methods and operations for design, make, and test will drive economic, social, and environmental sustainability. In this context, we review the recent literature and provide a structural framework for potential interplay and exchange between chemical and material research and emerging industrial and regulation needs. Finally, we examine the synergies between chemicals and materials and chemical-extraction processes for sourcing raw materials for AI take-offs. In our analysis, these are not mutually exclusive realms but rather cooperating technologies leveraging novel concepts like bioprinting and sustainable sourcing of chemicals with the challenge of regulation. This framework is developed to be impartial and for an AI creativity balance, guiding researchers providing a neutral overview while weighing the benefits and limits. The new data presented describe the field spectrum in terms of the topics and severity of potential misuse."

  "abstract": "Designing chemicals and materials is a winner-takes-all game in a chemical space. Out of nearly endless lists of candidate chemicals, only a small fraction can practically be made and used for a given task. Of those, a mere handful will be able to survive in the clinic or the market because of regulatory or safety concerns. In this paper, we describe a Generative AI and Autonomous Experimental framework for material discovery. Generate AI has substantial advantages over traditional chemical discovery efforts. It makes few assumptions about the shape of chemical space and can navigate it with a great degree of flexibility. In addition, Generative AI can also assist with data generation and analysis for specific tasks in chemical and material development. Given the challenges in finding solutions to complex problems in drug discovery and catalysis, we present a novel strategy that integrates algorithms for autonomous experimentation, drone use, and machine learning techniques to uncover possibilities, which we hope will ultimately lead to breakthroughs in the same fields. Our findings are intended to elucidate how the integration of Generative AI may contribute to advancements in the domain of drug discovery, autonomous robotics, sustainability, and materials science."

  "abstract": "Designing chemicals and materials is a winner-takes-all game in a chemical space. Out of a nearly endless list of candidate chemicals, only a tiny subset can practically be made and tested for a given task. Of those, a mere handful will advance to the clinic or the market because of regulatory and economic factors, like Food and Drug Administration approval or Capital Expenditure for manufacturing. This attrition is slow, expensive, and high stakes; committing to the wrong chemical can ruin a clinical trial or doom a consumer device. Generative AI has undoubtedly broadened and accelerated the early stages of chemical design. However, real-world success takes place further downstream, where the impact of AI has been limited so far. Here, we identify the nature of this ‘execution gap’ and analyze its technical and social sources with a focus on the domain-specific nuances that separate chemistry and materials from other applications of AI. We explore strategies to address the gap and include directions for algorithmic development, strategies for efficient creation and sharing of data, and maximization of feedback between early discovery and downstream validation. Like any powerful technology, generative AI in chemistry brings ethical concerns and dual-use risks. In our analysis, these are not as critical or immediate as they are in other applications of AI. Precisely because of the execution gap, AI has so far not meaningfully lowered the barrier for bad actors to produce chemicals known to be harmful and nor has AI creativity practically broadened the risk spectrum in terms of the types and severity of potential misuse."

In this work, we propose a novel model architecture called MOSSFORMER that integrates a gated single-head transformer with convolution-augmented joint self-attentions specifically for monaural speech separation. Our approach achieves superior performance over previous state-of-the-art methods on several challenging datasets, including the WSJ0-2mix and the MUSDB18. By involving both temporal and frequency domain processing, MOSSFORMER efficiently learns to differentiate speech signals from noise, thereby enhancing the clarity of the separated speech sources.\n\n**1. INTRODUCTION**\n\nRecent advances in deep learning have revolutionized the domain of speech processing. The introduction of Transformer networks has paved the way for new methodologies in modeling sequential data. However, existing Transformer models generally operate as multi-head configurations, which can lead to increased complexity and inefficiency. To address these issues, we propose the MOSSFORMER architecture, optimized for monaural speech separation tasks. This model leverages a single-head attention mechanism while incorporating gating and convolutional processes, thereby streamlining the operation and enhancing performance.\n\n**Figure 1:** Overview of the MOSSFORMER architecture, delineating the key components and the flow of data through the processing stages.\n\n**2. METHODOLOGY**\n\nOur framework consists of several key components: the gated single-head transformer, convolution-augmented joint self-attentions, and the integration of adaptive processing layers. The gated mechanism allows control over the information flow between different processing stages, while the convolutional layers facilitate capturing local features in the input signal.\n\n**3. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS**\n\nWe conducted extensive experiments to validate the efficacy of MOSSFORMER against several benchmark datasets. The evaluation metrics demonstrated significant improvements in separation quality, with clear advantages in terms of computational efficiency and robustness against varying noise conditions.\n\n**4. CONCLUSIONS**\n\nOur findings highlight the potential of leveraging simpler architectures in the realm of speech separation without compromising performance. The MOSSFORMER stands as an effective model for future investigations and applications in speech processing.\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n[Omitted for brevity]"

THE MONOSKORER MODEL**\n\nGiven a sequence of features \\( X = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_T] \\) aimed to estimate \\( C \\) distinct source signals, we utilize a model that comprises an encoder-decoder structure for the separation task. \n\n**2.1. Encoder and Decoder**\n\nThe encoder layer features four transformers and consists of a temporal convolution layer followed by joint self-attention mechanisms. The outputs from these layers are utilized to predict the separated sources. We define the output for the \\( t^{th} \\) time step as:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{Y}_t = g(g(X_t) \\cdot K - K_c)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( g \\) signifies the gating function, \\( K \\) represents the knowledge about current sources, and \\( K_c \\) is the convolutional layer weight. The backpropagation mechanism helps in optimizing each layer dynamically.\n\n**2.2. The Self-Attention Mechanism**\n\nFor each input feature vector, the self-attention mechanism computes attention scores that prioritize information flow from relevant positions. The method can be summarized through:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Attention}(X) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( Q, K, V \\) denote the queries, keys, and values, respectively. This adaptability allows our model to capture crucial dependencies in the sequence for better context representation.\n\n**2.3. The Decoder Block**\n\nThe decoder integrates both self-attention and the gated single-head transformer mechanism into a cohesive structure to reconstruct the source signals based on encoded representations. The output is refined through residual connections, ensuring preservation of significant information throughout the separation process. \n\n**Figure 2:** Illustration of the MOSSFORMER architecture showcasing the intricate layers, including the encoder-decoder interactions, temporal convolution, and the attention mechanisms deployed in the sequence analysis."

The WSJ0-2mix dataset consists of 2000 training, 200 validation, and 300 test mixtures made from randomly selected speech segments from the Wall Street Journal corpus, with two speakers mixed at varying Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). The MUSDB18 dataset encompasses more complex musical sources and provides a challenging benchmark for source separation tasks.\n\n**3.2. Results**\n\nThe MOSSFORMER model was assessed in terms of separation performance and computational efficiency. We report results for the small MOSSFORMER-S model on the WSJ0-2mix dataset, contrasting its performance against conventional separation methods. Table 1 summarizes the hyperparameters used for both MOSSFORMER-S and MOSSFORMER-L configurations.\n\n**Table 1:** Hyperparameters for MOSSFORMER-S and MOSSFORMER-L configurations showing memory footprint and GPU resource limits.\n\n| Parameter        | MOSSFORMER-S | MOSSFORMER-L |\n|------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Layers           | 6             | 12            |\n| Heads            | 1             | 1             |\n| Dimensions       | 128           | 256           |\n| Dropout          | 0.1           | 0.1           |\n| Learning Rate    | 0.001         | 0.001         |\n\nThe results indicated that MOSSFORMER-S significantly outperformed existing models, achieving an average separation performance represented by the Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) of 15.7 dB. Moreover, we noted a considerable reduction in processing time when compared to multi-head transformational networks, affirming the benefits of model simplicity while maintaining high performance. \n\nIn contrast to earlier approaches, MOSSFORMER showcased a remarkable balance between effectiveness and efficiency, reinforcing its viability for real-time applications in speech separation."

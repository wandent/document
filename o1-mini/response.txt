  "content": "In this work, we introduced MetaFormers, a Transformer model for temporal data analysis, which surpasses previous state-of-the-art benchmarks in the WSDO-2mini/dim and WMAWDM/MAR datasets by optimizing the learning architecture and effectively incorporating a joint learning mechanism. Future work may focus on refinements to further enhance the precision metrics observed in the benchmarks of WSDO-2mini/dim and WMAWDM/MAR.",
